# Property facet

IFC comes with a way to define custom data attached to objects called **Properties**.
The **Property Facet** is expected to be one of the most commonly used facets in the first version of IDS.

**Properties** have a **BaseName** (such as "FireRating") grouped in into **Property Sets** that help keep them organised by similar subject matters.
A property stores the relevant **Value** provided by the user (such as "180/180/180" in Australia); when appropriate the IFC format allows the specification of relevant units of measurement.

buildingSMART provides standardised **Property Sets** and **Properties** to help seamless data-exchange around the world.
For example, the "FireRating" **Property** is part of the "Pset\_WallCommon" **Property Set** as defined by buildingSMART.

Users can also define their own **Properties** and **Property Sets**, which may be unique to the project, or distributed using the **Property Set** templates feature of IFC.
Naturally, it is encouraged to require **Properties** that are standardised by buildingSMART before inventing custom ones.

All standardised **Property Set** have a reserved name prefixed (either "Pset_" or "Qto_"); it is prohibited to use the standardised prefixes "Pset_" and "Qto_" for custom properties.

Standardised **Properties** are applicable to different entities. For example, some properties such as **LoadBearing** can be applied to walls, columns, and beams, but not furniture, ducts, or cables.
This is known as the **Applicable Entity**.
When specifying **Properties** in an IDS, it is important to consider which objects they can apply to.
All sorts of objects can have **Properties** applied, not only physical objects like doors, windows, and slabs, but also non-physical objects like tasks, materials, structural profile cross sections, or labour resources.

A special type of **Property** is known as a **Quantity**.
Whereas **Properties** refer to any arbitrary information about an object, **Quantities** refer specifically to calculated dimensions of the object, such as length, width, height, surface area, or net volume.
IFC makes a distinction between **Properties** and **Quantities**, but in IDS they are interchangeable, and you are allowed to specify **Quantities** just the same as a **Property** with this facet.
Just like **Properties**, **Quantities** are grouped into **Quantity Sets** and have a **Value**.

To see what **Properties** are standardised by buildingSMART, check the following lists below.
You will see a list of **Property Sets**. Clicking on a **Property Set** will bring you to its page,
which will show the **Applicable Entity** just below the page title, as well as a table of **Property Names** and expected data types for the **Values**, and have an **Applicable Entity**.

- [IFC2X3 Property Sets](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC2x3/TC1/HTML/psd/psd_index.htm)

Note that IFC2X3 only has buildingSMART standardised properties, not quantities.

Instead of checking the documentation, your IDS authoring software may help you to shortlist valid **Property Sets**.

In IDS facets, **Properties** may have a data type that constrains the expected format in which the property will be stored (e.g. text value, a boolean, or a number).
If it is a number, the value will be unit-less, such as a count of a value and the unit dependent on the measure associated with teh specified `dataType`.
Our [unit documentation](units.md) provides the list of acceptable measures and the SI unit used for their expression. For more information consult the IFC documentation at the following links:

IDS currently specifies all measure-based values based on SI units. You can see the full list of units specified for each data type in the [IDS units table](units.md).
Note that although you can use a data type to request a particular measurement (e.g. an IFCLENGTHMEASURE), you cannot use IDS to request that the length is measured with a particular unit (e.g. meters, inches, or millimeters).

Properties are critical providing supplementary information to objects in a model.

It is encouraged to follow buildingSMART standardised **Properties** wherever possible to ensure that data is highly structured and can be predictably retrieved.
