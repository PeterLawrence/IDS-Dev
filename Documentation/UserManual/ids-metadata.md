# Guide to effective IDS metadata

IDS is designed to be readable by both humans and computers. Just as it is important to precisely and accurately describe **Specifications** to computers, it is equally important to describe the purpose, intentions, and utility of the **Specifications** to recipients of the IDS. This is achieved by filling out **Specification** metadata. When model authors, designers, engineers, clients, consultants, and other stakeholders clearly understand why information is needed, who it benefits, and when it will be used, it will help guarantee that requirements are met effectively.

## IDS metadata

Each `.ids` file has basic metadata that are common to all **Specifications** listed inside the IDS.

| Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Specification metadata

Each **Specification** has metadata to help describe the goals and instructions of how to achieve it.

| description  | Describe why the requirement is important to the project. The person reading the description should understand why the information provides value, which workflows it helps to achieve, and what project benefits will be sacrificed if the requirements are not met. | "Basic properties that have significant impacts on costing, detailing, and building renovations must be included to minimise construction risk."          |
| instructions | Provide instructions on who is responsible to provide the information and details on how it is achieved, such as guidelines on how a naming convention works, how to choose an appropriate value, or what to do in edge-cases                                         | "Architects and code consultants are responsible for providing this information.

|ifcVersion | What IFC version(s) are expected. Options: "IFC2X3", "IFC4", "IFC4X3_ADD2" | "IFC4X3_ADD2" |
|identifier | For clear and unambiguous identification, allowing for easier tracking, referencing, and reporting. It should be unique within an IDS file. | "SP01", "Fire-001", "5b1b0426-a21d-4ee9-9b53-e9b7827690a7" |
